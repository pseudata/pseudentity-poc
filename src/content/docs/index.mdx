## Identity Provider & Visual Companion

**Pseudentity** is a **stateless OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider** and visual companion for the [pseudata](https://pseudata.dev) ecosystem. Add "Login with Pseudentity" to your apps for testing and development—no real auth provider setup required.

Built on **PseudoID** (UUID v8), every identity is entirely stateless—no database, no sessions. Just decode the ID to regenerate the complete profile on demand.

## Key Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="OpenID Connect Provider" icon="star">
    **Add "Login with Pseudentity" to your apps.** OIDC-compliant with signed JWTs—no sessions, no database. Perfect for testing auth flows without configuring real identity providers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Profile Viewer" icon="open-book">
    Visualize any generated user with a rich UI, avatar, and metadata. Jump to any user instantly using their PseudoID.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mock Enterprise (SCIM 2.0)" icon="setting">
    Test user provisioning flows with infinite, paginated employee lists. Perfect for testing Okta or Azure AD integrations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero Database" icon="rocket">
    Entirely stateless—uses CPU (math) instead of storage. Every profile is calculated on-demand from the PseudoID.

## Why Pseudentity?

Testing authentication in development typically requires:
- **Expensive third-party providers** - Auth0, Okta, or other SaaS identity platforms
- **Managing test databases** - Storing and maintaining fake user accounts
- **Coordinating credentials** - Sharing test logins across teams
- **Resetting state** - Cleaning up between test runs

**Pseudentity eliminates all of this** by making identities completely stateless and deterministic. No database. No sessions. Just pure math.

## How It Works

Pseudentity uses **PseudoID**, a custom UUID v8 format that encodes generation parameters directly into the 128-bit ID space:

```
SSSSSSSS-SSSS-8SSS-vSTT-TTIIIIIIIII

64 bits: World Seed (universe ID)
16 bits: Type Sequence (User = 101)
40 bits: Index (0 to 1.1 trillion)
```

This allows any server to "inflate" a full user profile instantly just by decoding the ID—no database lookups required.

## Use Cases

- **Testing Auth Flows** - Add OIDC login to your app without configuring Auth0, Okta, or other real identity providers
- **Local Development** - Test authentication features locally with deterministic, repeatable identities
- **Profile Visualization** - See what your generated users actually look like with avatars and metadata
- **Enterprise SSO Testing** - Simulate SCIM provisioning flows for Okta, Azure AD, or other enterprise identity systems
- **Sales Demos** - Show authentication features with consistent, professional-looking identities

## Powered by Pseudata

Pseudentity is built on top of [pseudata](https://pseudata.dev), the deterministic mock data generator that produces identical data across all programming languages.
